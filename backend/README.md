# Viridian City Bank - Backend

> **Note**: For the complete dockerized setup including frontend, see the main project README and DOCKER_README.md in the root directory.

This directory contains the Go backend for Viridian City Bank. The backend can be run standalone for development or as part of the unified Docker container.

## Development Setup (Standalone Backend)

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or higher
- SQLite (database file included)

### Quick Start
```bash
cd backend
go mod download
go run .
```

The backend will start on port 8080 and serve API endpoints at `/api/*`.

## üê≥ Docker (Recommended)

For production use, use the unified Docker setup from the root directory:
```bash
cd .. # Go to project root
./run.sh
# OR
docker-compose up --build
```

This will run both frontend and backend together in a single container.

## Development vs Docker

### Development Mode (Standalone)
- Backend only on port 8080
- Frontend served separately (if needed)
- Good for backend development and testing

### Docker Mode (Unified)
- Backend + Frontend in one container
- Backend serves static files AND API
- Production-ready setup
- Access everything at http://localhost:8080

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/change-password` - Change password (requires auth)
